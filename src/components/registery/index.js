      <p>Many of you are travelling across the country or from different countries to celebrate with us in Cornwall, so your presence means the world to us and is all we ask for. If you'd still like to contribute to our registery or honeymoon funds, please check out our registery below.</p>

      <p>When contributing money to our funds there's an optional charge of 3.9% + 20p</p>
