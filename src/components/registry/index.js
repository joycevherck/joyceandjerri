      <h2>The registry</h2>
      <p>Many of you are travelling across the country or from different countries to celebrate with us in Cornwall, so your presence means the world to us and is all we ask for. If you'd still like to contribute to our registry or honeymoon funds, please check out our registry below.</p>

      <p>When contributing money to our funds there's a small transaction fee from the registry website that you can choose to cover as part of your transaction. Alternatively feel free to ask us for our bank details or bring cash to the wedding.</p>
